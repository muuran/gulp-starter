#**Lots of new stuff happening in the [2.0 branch](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter/tree/2.0)**
2.0 could use a better README, and will be merged as soon as it gets one... but it's way better, and you can and should use it now. 

**Use Rails?** Check out http://viget.com/extend/gulp-rails-asset-pipeline and https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-rails-pipeline

## Live Demo
http://greypants.github.io/gulp-starter/
Result of running `gulp deploy`

## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Start gulp for local development
```
npm run watch
```
or 

```
gulp
```
To use gulp commands directly, you may need to alias `gulp` to `node_modules/.bin/gulp`, or `npm install -g gulp`.

Start editing assets and views from the `gulp/assets` and `gulp/views` folder. Files compile to `public`.

## Preview production environment
```
npm start
```

or 

```
gulp build:production
gulp server
```

## Deploy to GitHub pages
```
npm run deploy
```
This will run karma, build your files, revision and compress them, and copy the contents of the public folder to a `gh-pages` branch, and push it up to GitHub.
